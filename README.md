# Pomodoro-Clock
This was a coding project as a part of the Front End Library qualification of [freecodecamp.org](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock/)

## What does it do?

The clock works as a timer that counts down to zero. You can set the timer to any time up to 24 hrs. Once the timer reaches zero, it gives a visual signal.

## What I learned
* basic CSS styling
* using jquery
